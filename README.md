## How to play?

rules are [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht#Overview)

- If you want to choose a pawn, just select a number from 1-4
- Your pawns are numbered based on proximity to the finish line. 
- Additional info: If your pawn is not on the board, you can get it on board by pressing any key (1-4) as all the pawns are in the same proximity to the finish line
- But if you have any pawns on the board, it's crucial to keep in mind and not mindlessly press keys, as you can lose your turn.

Before making the project, I made initial specs, and while doing the project, I made small revisions. You can find the final specs [here](project_specs.md)

## Retrospection on this project:
- I have learned fastapi, even though it's probably written in the most pythonic way, nor in a way that's the most modern and advised by documentation (because of my lack of skills). Next time, I will make it much clearer.
- I despise pygame
- I had to recap on how to do shell scripts, how [UNIX pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) work (so I can focus on just the important logs from fastapi)
- I made [and published my first container image](https://github.com/users/nougcat/packages?repo_name=man-dont-get-angry)
- made a debian package, but I have decided to not publish it

overall this project was a PITA, but I have learned a lot
